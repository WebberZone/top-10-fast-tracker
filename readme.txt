Addon for Top 10 that incorporates a high performance tracker.

== Description ==

Older versions of [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) included a high performance tracker that worked with an external JavaScript file loading a minimal WordPress environment. This free addon will allow you to bring back this tracker and significantly speed up Top 10.

This plugin is an addon to the [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) plugin. You must have Top 10 v3.x installed for this plugin to work.
