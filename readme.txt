Addon for Top 10 that incorporates a high performance tracker.

== Description ==

Older versions of [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) included a high performance tracker that worked with an external excel file loading a minimal WordPress environment. This free addon will allow you to bring back this tracker and significantly speed up Top 10.
